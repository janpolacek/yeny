Write a simple single-page app for event administration in vanilla Javascript (but also feel free to use any JS framework you see fit, if it helps you). The app should have a list of upcoming and past events and a form for creating a new event. When user selects an event on the list, details of the event should appear somewhere.

The point of this is to demonstrate your programming habits and show styling (CSS) skills.

Moreover, if you decide to use a framework or library (or not to use any), please give a brief explanation why.
